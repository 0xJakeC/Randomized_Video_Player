This Python script creates a simple web-based video player that randomly
selects and plays episodes from *Family Guy*. The application is built with
Flask and features:

- **Random Episode Selection**: Automatically picks a random episode from
your media library to play (I chose family guy).
- **Responsive HTML Template**: Includes styling for dark mode, full-screen
viewing, and basic controls.
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts the video volume to 50% upon page load, this can be changed but some of my .mp4s were loud.
- **Autoplay Feature**: Continuously plays the next episode after the current
one finishes.

**Key Features:**
- Uses Flask for rendering and serving web content
- Includes basic HTML styling for a modern viewing experience
- Auto-scrolls to display updates as new episodes load

**Note:** This script is intended for local use. Pls don't host publicly!!
